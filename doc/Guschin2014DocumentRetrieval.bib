	Genetic Programming},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Pareto genetic programming methodology is extended by additional generic
	model selection and generation strategies that (1) drive the modeling
	engine to creation of models of reduced non-linearity and increased
	generalization capabilities, and (2) improve the effectiveness of
	the search for robust models by goal softening and adaptive fitness
	evaluations. In addition to the new strategies for model development
	and model selection, this dissertation presents a new approach for
	analysis, ranking, and compression of given multi-dimensional input-response
	data for the purpose of balancing the information content of undesigned
	data sets.},
